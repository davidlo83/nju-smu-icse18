%Problem with Bug, Need for bug localization
An active software project often receives numerous bug reports daily~\cite{AnvikHM05}. To resolve each report, developers often need to spend much time and effort~\cite{Tassey02}. One main task that developers need to do during debugging is to identify code that needs to be fixed to resolve the bug. This task, often referred to as {\em bug localization}, is a non-trivial one as relevant files need to be identified out of a collection of hundreds or even thousands of files.

%Existing work on bug localization, Recent trend on supervised bug localization (IJCAI16,17)
To help developers in locating bugs, various automated solutions have been proposed~\cite{JonesH05,lukins2008source,rao2011retrieval,SahaLKP14,huo2016learning}. Many of them analyze the description of a bug report to identify source code files relevant to it~\cite{lukins2008source,rao2011retrieval,SahaLKP14,huo2016learning}. These text-based solutions can be further divided into two families: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised solutions, which were historically proposed first, typically employ information retrieval techniques to identify files that contain many words that appear in the bug report~\cite{lukins2008source,rao2011retrieval,SahaLKP14}. More recently, supervised approaches are introduced~\cite{huo2016learning}. These approaches use a collection of bug reports and their relevant source code files as training data. This data is then used to learn a good model that can map new bug reports to their respective relevant source code files. Supervised approaches have been shown to be superior than unsupervised ones.

%Limitation with supervised - cold start problem, no data.
One limitation of a supervised approach is the need for sufficient and high quality training data. Insufficient or low quality data can be detrimental to its effectiveness. This problem is particularly important when a bug localization approach needs to be applied to new projects having a limited bug fixing history. Unfortunately, this issue, often referred to as the {\em cold-start problem}, has not been explored much by past supervised bug localization studies.

%Our approach
To address the above mentioned limitation, in this work, we propose {\em Deep Transfer Bug Localization} (DTBL) task. DTBL deals with the cold-start problem affecting a target software project by adapting data from other projects. We propose the first DTBL solution, namely \TRANPCNN, which combines deep and transfer learning to address the cold-start problem. \TRANPCNN first extracts the transferable latent features from bug reports and source code files of source and target projects, and then these features are leveraged to generate project-specific predictions for localizing bugs for both source and target projects.

%Novelty over prior work (TCA+, etc.)
There have been a few transfer learning solutions designed to help with cold-start problem in software engineering context. For example, Turhan et al.~\cite{TurhanMBS09} proposed Burak Filter to select $k$ instances from source project that are most similar to the target domain when constructing a defect prediction model for the target project. Nam et al.~\cite{Nam2013transfer} proposed another transfer approach called TCA+ , which maps source and target domain data into a latent space using unsupervised component analysis for cross-project defect prediction. Our approach is unique from previous solutions in the following ways. First, our approach is the first approach ever addressing the cross-project bug localization problem, while the previous approaches are designed for cross-project defect prediction. Second, our approach relies on a deep transfer learning model \TRANPCNN for cross-project bug localization, while all the previous solutions rely on shallow models. Third, our solution is an end-to-end solution that takes a bug report and a source code in their raw format as input and directly output the bug localization result. On the other hand, previous solutions, either the one based on relevant instance selection or latent space construction, consist of multiple steps, where subsequent steps can only work based on the results from preceding steps, even if the results are not suitable for the subsequent steps. 



%employs two convolutional neural network to extract semantic features for bug localization; Second, TRANP-CNN employs transferable feature extraction layers to improve bug localization performance; Third, TRANP-CNN can fully exploit the advantage in using the labeled data from target project, while TCA only uses the distribution of target domain for transfer task in an unsupervised manner. In addition, NP-CNN proposed by Huo et al.~\cite{huo2016learning} has shown good performance in bug localization by introducing particular framework to learn unified features from bug reports and source code. TRANP-CNN is unique from NP-CNN in the way that TRANP-CNN employs a project-specific prediction layer to apply two fully-connected network to train predictors separately from source project and target projects, which enjoy the advantage in extracting the high-level semantic features with the same deep model and training the prediction networks using different models to overcome the inconsistency data distribution. \dl{Please compare the approach with existing work and highlight its novelty.}

%Experiment results

We evaluate the effectiveness of \TRANPCNN on 6 cross-project bug localization tasks involving well-known open source projects. Our experimental results highlight the need for DBTL as existing solutions cannot effectively make use of data from other projects to create a model that can accurately locate bugs in a target project. The results also show that \TRANPCNN outperforms previous state-of-the-art bug localization methods on all 6 tasks across all evaluation measures. In addition, the results highlight the effectiveness of the key components of \TRANPCNN, i.e., the transferable feature extraction layer and the project-specific prediction layer.

%List of contributions
Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item We present a new direction of research on cross-project bug localization. We highlight that existing supervised bug localization techniques are unable to perform well when they are trained using data from other projects. 
    
\item We propose a novel deep transfer learning model named \TRANPCNN which learns a transferable latent features shared by both source and target project, and generate project-specific prediction to facilitate a supervised knowledge transfer from the source project to the target project.


% transfer modelemploys programming language specific convolutional neural network to extract transferable semantic features, and a novel heterogeneous predicting adaptation layers are designed to improve cross-project bug localization performance.  

\item Experiments on the well-known open source projects indicate that \TRANPCNN is capable of leveraging rich information from the source project and limited information from the target project to achieve a significantly better performances than the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Top-k rank, MAP and MRR, suggesting that \TRANPCNN is effective for cross-project bug localization.
